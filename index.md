Theoretical physicist with an interest taking on new challenges involving machine learning, data science, mathematics and statistics, and computer science. I have previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Physics](https://www.mpp.mpg.de/en/){:target="_blank"} in Munich. I was also a postdoc at [The University of Amsterdam](https://iop.uva.nl/itfa/themes/particlephysics/particlephysics.html){:target="_blank"} (though I spent most of my time at [Nikhef](https://theory.web.nikhef.nl/){:target="_blank"}) from 2017-2020. I obtained my PhD in 2017 from [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/physics/){:target="_blank"} where I was a member of the [Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}.

I intend to upload some notes which I have written (or half written) during my time in physics. They mostly concern specific calculations/conepts/problems which I either found difficult or had to work out as I went along. Who knows, maybe making them available here might be helpful to someone else too.
